## General

### How is the Library Manager index generated?

[The Library Manager index](http://downloads.arduino.cc/libraries/library_index.json) contains the data for every release of every one of the thousands of libraries that have been added to the Library Manager list. This index is used by Library Manager to provide installation and updates of the libraries as well as to generate automated documentation pages for the [Arduino Library Reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/).

Every hour, the automated Library Manager indexer system:

1. checks every repository in the Library Manager list for new tags, updating [the logs](https://github.com/arduino/library-registry/blob/main/FAQ.md#can-i-check-on-library-releases-being-added-to-library-manager) accordingly
1. checks whether those tags meet [the requirements for addition to the index](https://github.com/arduino/library-registry/blob/main/FAQ.md#update-requirements)
1. adds entries to the index for compliant tags
1. pushes the updated index to Arduino's download server

## Lint

```sh
arduino-lint --recursive --library-manager submit
arduino-lint --compliance strict
